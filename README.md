# CodeExercise

Use this repository as a starting point for the coding exercise.

## Summary of Solution

### Solution file structure

- CodeExercise.App
  - [References CodeExercise.Core]
  - Program.cs: main console program
- CodeExercise.Core
  - FizzBuzzEngine.cs: starter implementation of FizzBuzz
- CodeExercise.WebApi
  - [References CodeExercise.Core]
  - Controllers
    - WeatherForecastController: boilerplate example controller example
  - Pages
    - Index.cshtml: root page of WebApi app
  - Program.cs: asp.net core program

## Step 1

### Setup

- Clone or download this repository
- Ensure you can build and run the CodeExercise.App console application. You should see the partially implemented FizzBuzz output:

- Ensure you can build and run the CodeExercise.WebApi asp.net core application (not at the same time). You should see, after submitting this form:
  - <img width="479" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a1b09985-f5e3-4908-9deb-74823c4ce177">


## Step 2

### Code Exercise At-Home Assignment

Detailed instructions have been provided to you separately. To summarize:

1. Complete an implementation of FizzBuzz. You can use FizzBuzzEngine.cs or start from scratch.
2. Consider how your implementation can be improved & expanded

You do not need to make any git commits, establish a repo or submit a PR. You will share your screen during the virtual interview.

## Step 3

### Virtual Interview

1. We will start the interview by reviewing your FizzBuzz solution, discussing your approach, and walking through the code together.
2. Next, we will expand the FizzBuzz implementation based on additional requirements revealed during the interview.
